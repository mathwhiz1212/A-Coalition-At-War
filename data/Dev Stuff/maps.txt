planet "Forpelog 2"
	attributes "quarg quarg" moon quarg
	landscape land/canyon03
	description `Forpelog is a Quarg mining world, barely habitable by their standards and, because of its low gravity, unsuitable for long-term human habitation. The Quarg city is a marvel of advanced technology, entirely enclosed within glass and steel, with gardens and terraces where alien trees and plants grow. Outside the city, the landscape is rugged and beautiful, but the atmosphere is too thin to breathe and contains almost no oxygen.`
	spaceport `Your ship is docked on a metal pad immediately outside the dome of the city, which towers over you. Immediately after you landed, a smaller canopy unfolded around your ship, sealing it in and providing enough air for you to breathe as you make your way inside. The stark, lifeless badlands outside give way to bustling streets and lush blue foliage within. No other human beings are in sight.`

planet "Lagrange 2"
	attributes "quarg quarg" quarg station
	landscape land/station5
	description `The Quarg built this station centuries ago, before they began construction on the ringworld. From the dark side of the station, the ring is visible as a thin bright filament stretching out to either side of the system's sun. The ring itself is closed to human visitors, but tour shuttles depart from here on a regular basis, giving human tourists a closer view of this engineering feat that is so far beyond anything human beings have ever attempted to build.`
	spaceport `In the docking section are flexible, oddly organic-looking tubes that snaked out to connect to your ship as it approached. Walking through the tube and into the station was a somewhat disconcerting experience. Inside, crowds of human tourists gawk at the tall, thin Quarg, who for the most part seem unfazed by the attention. The station is perfectly clean; every surface shines.`

planet "Grakhord 2"
	attributes "quarg quarg" moon quarg
	landscape land/badlands6
	description `Although human beings who do not mind living in low gravity are welcome to settle here, Grakhord is part of Quarg territory, and has been terraformed to meet their environmental needs rather than those of human beings. The full extent of the Quarg mining operations here are not known, but rumors say that they have tunnels reaching down almost halfway to the moon's core, and Quarg ships can also sometimes be seen harvesting hydrogen gas from the upper atmosphere of the gas giant that Grakhord orbits.`
	spaceport `Here, you feel like a young child lost among a crowd of tall, indifferent adults. The average adult Quarg is over three meters tall, and although they move slowly and gracefully, on their long legs they easily speed by you. Worse, the counters for the merchant exchange, bank, and job board are high enough that you can barely see over them. But, the Quarg have helpfully provided stepping stools stashed under the counters so that shorter humans can carry out business without having to constantly crane their necks upwards.`

planet "Kuwaru Efreti 2"
	attributes "quarg quarg" quarg station
	landscape land/station20
	description `This Quarg ringworld is almost half completed, but there are no signs of active construction, and your ship's sensors picked up no energy signals from any section of the ring except for this one. You also observed superficial weapon scars on some parts of the ring, damage that the Quarg have not bothered to repair - although clearly the attackers did not possess weapons powerful enough to do any serious harm to the ring.`
	spaceport `Despite their size, the Quarg are generally almost silent when they move, and there seem to be very few of them left inhabiting this ringworld. As you walk through some parts of the spaceport it is utterly silent and seemingly deserted, and you are jolted by surprise each time the illusion of solitude is broken by a Quarg emerging suddenly from a doorway and striding silently past you. Every once in a while, louder footsteps announce the presence of a group of Korath visiting the station.`
	spaceport `	Although the spaceport offers all the usual amenities, including a small merchant's exchange for trading goods, you feel slightly self-conscious about breaking the silence of the station to speak to anyone.`

planet "Homr Peace Planet"
	attributes "quarg quarg" quarg station
	landscape land/station19
	description `This is a complete Quarg ringworld, the product of millennia of construction effort which has consumed every other stellar object in this system in order to provide the raw materials. The inner edge of the ring is filled with solar panels, hydroponic gardens, living quarters, and sunlit common spaces. The outer edge contains hangars and docks for ships, and storage facilities for cargo.`
	description `	Massive station-keeping thrusters on the ring's exterior keep its orbit from becoming unstable.`
	spaceport `If this section of the ring is any indication, there must be trillions of Quarg here. Since the construction work on the ring has long since ended, many of them seem to spend their time with creative or scientific endeavors instead. The spaceport is decorated with artwork of every imaginable kind: sculptures, mobiles, paintings, music, and even one hallway that cycles through various artificial odors, some of them intensely unpleasant to your human senses.`
