	description "Forpelog is a Quarg mining world, barely habitable by their standards and, because of its low gravity, unsuitable for long-term human habitation. The Quarg city is a marvel of advanced technology, entirely enclosed within glass and steel, with gardens and terraces where alien trees and plants grow. Outside the city, the landscape is rugged and beautiful, but the atmosphere is too thin to breathe and contains almost no oxygen."
	spaceport "Your ship is docked on a metal pad immediately outside the dome of the city, which towers over you. Immediately after you landed, a smaller canopy unfolded around your ship, sealing it in and providing enough air for you to breathe as you make your way inside. The stark, lifeless badlands outside give way to bustling streets and lush blue foliage within. No other human beings are in sight."
