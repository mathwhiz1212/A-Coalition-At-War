You now have access to select Quarg outfits once you depart and land again. There may be a special mission or two on the job board. You are also a fugitive from the Coalition/Heliarch.`

		dialog `Since you have proven yourself trustworthy, we do not want you to be unable to survive future missions. We are therefore allowing you to purchase our normal ships. They are not cheap, so we will also let you purchase antimatter cores. If you are caught sharing any of our technology with anyone else, we will destroy you.`
