	description "The workings of the jump drive are a total mystery. The best that human scientists have been able to find out is that this device is a containment field for matter in a state that cannot normally exist in this universe; if the drive is opened up, the field collapses and its contents disappear. Therefore, even though a few jump drives have been captured over the years, it has so far proved impossible to reverse engineer them."

	description "This Quantum Deionizer makes you virtually immune to ion damage at a high cost. The ion sheath it creates gives a 10% reduction to shield & hull damage. It slows down your ship A LOT, uses a lot of WEAPON space, and might be the hottest outfit. Is immunity worth it? I don't know. Seems like someone could just kill you with a flamethrower."

	description "This reactor was designed for the most powerful Heliarch warships. Its design has not changed significantly in the millennia since the first battle with the Quarg, but each generation of reactors is made slightly more efficient than the previous ones. This new generation has cooling built-in which allows it to be more space efficient."

	description `The way the advanced pod fires looks suspiciously like a Pug seeker. Maybe they reverse-engineered alien tech to make it? Finisher Torpedoes are one of the Heliarchs' most dreaded weapons. In fact, in one way or another most of their other weapons merely exist to hold a ship in place for long enough for a barrage of Finishers to destroy it.`
